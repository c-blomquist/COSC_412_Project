To run the website locally using localhost you need to use xampp. You also need to create a local database through xampp to use the login system.    

Name the database cosc412 and add a table for users.

For the recommendation system you need to run the following command with python installed:  
```bash
pip install spotipy
```

Check the spotipy gitHub for more information.  

You will also need to connect to the Spotify API through the client information shared in the resource document, or use your own spotify API information.
