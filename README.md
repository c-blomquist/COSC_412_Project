We will be using https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-amazing-music-recommendation-system-4cce2719a572 as part of our project for the music reccomendations. 

We will also incorperate an appropiate background image for the website so that it will be pleasing to the eye. Such other examples may include moving text (text pop-ups or text moving from left to right on the screen) color fonts, font size variations, and a brief caption about why we want a user to use our service (ex - popular musican or artist)-> https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/what-makes-an-excellent-artist-image.
